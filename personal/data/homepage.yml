  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am Luke Powers of California, born and raised. I attended the
    University of California at Riverside to get my Bachelor of
    Science degree in Computer Science. I then entered the software
    industry in Northern Los Angeles where I decided to settle down
    and have a family. I am an avid soccer/football fan, and in my off
    time can be found either playing (midfielder), coaching (10U-19U)
    or watching (Go Man United!) the beautiful game.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My area of focus lies in designing and building back-end solutions
    for large scale projects. I enjoy the development process as much
    as communicating with other developers and end users to ensure we
    improve the experiences that reach business goals.
