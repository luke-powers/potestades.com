  content: '<p class="lead">

    I am Luke Powers of California, born and raised. I have been
    coaching with AYSO since 2017, having run an All Star team each
    year as well. I am an avid soccer/football fan, and can be found
    either playing (midfielder), or watching (Go Man United!) the
    beautiful game.

    </p>
    <p class="lead">

    My Philosophy is to help players develop appropriate soccer TEAM
    skills and provide chances for players to work towards achieving
    personal development goals in soccer.

    To this end, the skills of passing, shooting and off the ball
    movement are emphasized over nutmegs and fancy flicks.

    Players are expected to be aggressive and constantly striving to
    make a difference in the game.
